# Improving Project Security in CI/CD
## Description
Security scanning in a project pipeline is almost always one of the last things that is considered and added by organizations, large and small. Why? Because it's viewed that incorporation of appsec tooling into a CI pipeline is either expensive or difficult - cost of tooling, time spent in a sprint to add the tooling, and so on. I'm here to help assure you that adding low-cost (or no-cost!) tools can be approachable and doable to ensure greater security in your application.

In this talk, we'll explore:

- Common security issues in JS projects
- The value in remediating security issues early and often
- Tools which will help you harden your JS project (various free and commercial tooling options, including npm audit, Snyk, etc.)
- How to integrate these tools not only within local dev, but also within your CI/CD pipeline

For the last point of discussion, we'll walk through various examples of setup in commonly used CI tools including Jenkins, GitlabCI, CircleCI, Drone, and other tools as time permits.

## Skill Level
**Intermediate**. This talk assumes a base proficiency in importance of CI/CD principles and base knowledge of CI/CD tooling setup.

## Other Notes for Organizers
1. I am not a sales person and am not paid by any of the commercial companies mentioned in the talk. I just care about this problem set a lot.
1. The demos will be video-recorded to ensure that the timings are solid and there's no "oops!" moments on stage.
